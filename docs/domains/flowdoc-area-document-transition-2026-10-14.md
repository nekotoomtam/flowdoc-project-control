# Area-based document structure transition

## Authority Boundary

Owner: FlowDoc Project Control. This is the shared design, execution plan and
progress record for the owner's seven-step direction change on2026-10-14.
It is not implementation evidence or a release claim. Core owns validation,
binding and pagination; Service owns storage, public contracts and consumers.
Private SRS data stays outside Git. Supersedes further memory-optimization work
as the next objective; accepted release0.2.14 and its evidence remain history.

## Authorization and working arrangement

Owner approved the seven steps and explicitly said to draft and start, then
confirmed the API shape `sections.body.data.details: [{format,data}]`.
No new object-valued Area mode is requested. The field name is the lookup key;
the Area value remains an ordered array. Design may be refined with concrete
examples during work; do not silently expand or hard-code SRS semantics.

Single-room inline work under flowdoc-workflow-economy-v2; execution IDs N/A.
Roles: Planning Partner/Cross-Repo Boundary Reviewer for discovery, Product
Implementation Agent for later candidate edits, Evidence Reviewer for checks.
Size large, risk routine with explicit schema/publication/data-loss risks.
Initial authority is discovery only with respect to product runtime; isolated
candidate fixtures are experimental outputs, never shared product truth.
Use isolated sibling worktrees for runtime changes. No remote push, production
DB operation, published-snapshot rewrite, Editor implementation or release-tag
rewrite. Service/Core checkouts currently point at release0.2.14 snapshots
`4de27a5`/`ce6ff28`; do not switch or edit those primary branches.
Model decision: retain this user-selected session for inline discovery; host
catalog provides gpt-6-astra/medium as planning policy default. No separate
execution/model dispatch is created or claimed. Reassess implementation needs
after discovery; do not invent a host/model switch.

## Agreed design

- The whole document owns shared variables and ordered sections. `Doc` is an
  explanatory word, not a required API rename.
- Section owns paper dimensions/orientation/margins and its own header/footer.
  It may span pages. Its authored graph contains static nodes and variable
  placements; section variables are shared within that section.
- Area is a named variable with an explicit placement linked by stable areaId.
  It accepts an ordered array of entries. Each entry chooses an owned Format
  and supplies that Format's local data. The caller never supplies node graphs.
- Format is a fragment/group of nodes, not a page and not an indivisible page
  block. Its tables may continue across pages.
- An explicit page-break node is authored by the template owner. No automatic
  inference from heading text/numbering. Breaks do not change Section settings;
  consecutive/leading/trailing breaks must not create accidental empty pages.
- The SRS target uses section-variable Areas, replacing direct content-format
  placement. Section boundaries follow actual page/header/footer requirements.
- Existing header/first-column centering is the visual baseline.

## Seven-step execution and acceptance

1. Define terminology and contracts. Resolve variable scope, allowed placement,
   empty/missing/invalid input, ordered expansion and break semantics. Classify
   whole-document naming as context-only; split Section layout from Area data.
   Acceptance: template/request examples demonstrate the owner's confirmed shape.
2. Inventory current implementation. Trace Core template/types, sectionOwnership,
   areas, prepareSections/prepareAreas, expandAreas/expandRows, composeSections,
   resolved validation and documentFlow. Trace Service assembly, contract,
   publication, image traversal and API example. Identify supported behavior,
   missing behavior and deletion candidates with actual consumers. Probe SRS
   conversion through public Core validation/preparation/composition first.
3. Build separate SRS template/request. Preserve scalar values/images/order;
   replace content sections with authored Area placements and area-owned formats.
   Keep original input immutable during comparison. Produce an explicit mapping
   and fail on dropped/duplicated values. Do not prematurely consolidate sections
   until explicit breaks can preserve intended page transitions.
4. Implement only demonstrated gaps. Add meaningful failing tests first for
   affected contracts: owned formats, repeated/grouped rows, invalid entries,
   bounds, anchors/TOC/links and page-break edge cases. Version new persisted
   semantics deliberately; no broad model-number substitutions. Publishable
   snapshots must remain immutable. Use packed Core in isolated Linux Service
   consumer before claiming package integration.
5. Verify full document. First prove structural migration with unchanged page
   layout against centered98-page reference. Compare drawing/resources/text/
   links, values/order and groups. Then test explicitly authored breaks separately;
   accept page-number changes only with correct TOC/link destinations. Visually
   inspect representative changed pages. No API layout heuristics.
6. Measure performance anew. Same input/output arrangement, machine/container
   limits and lightweight external sampler for old/new. Three alternating cold
   runs per candidate for98pages, report median/range/peak working set and total
   cgroup separately. After correctness/guards pass, repeat at483pages. Preserve
   API1GiB/2CPU, DB256MiB, host reserve/stop controls from capacity evidence.
   Proposed investigation trigger: >10% median worker or peak working-set
   regression; not a retrospective pass threshold. Record limitations and resolve
   regression before cutover. No new memory optimization unless findings require it.
7. Cut over and retire. Switch active examples/manuals/client contracts to the new
   path. Inventory each old artifact/code path as migrate/delete/still-used
   compatibility/history before deletion. Delete genuinely unused implementations,
   fixtures and temporary outputs; retain only named necessary proof and immutable
   published history. Verify no dangling references and run affected checks after
   removal. An unresolved still-used path is an explicit remaining obligation,
   not permission to call cleanup complete. No deletion of unrelated user files.

## Proof and document budgets

One shared plan/progress record here; update the existing capacity roadmap only
to point at this direction. Product README/usage changes only when behavior is
implemented. No maps promoted by plans. Evidence in ignored Service
`artifacts/area-transition-20261014/`; minimal public synthetic fixtures/tests in
owner repositories. One discovery probe, focused tests per actual runtime change,
one affected full suite per stable candidate, paired PDF checks and bounded
performance matrix above. Repeat only for changed content, failures or uncovered
affected behavior. One final review of the integrated change; owner revisions
update this record rather than spawning report copies.

## Open decisions and review focus

- Area entries currently may be skipped with warnings: prevent silent SRS data
  loss; decide versioned strict semantics before changing public behavior.
- Verify grouped rows, image discovery and source diagnostics through Area;
  do not assume support solely from types.
- Keep authored breaks separate from Section transitions and empty content.
- Existing release/published consumers may still need legacy readers: identify
  them before deciding retirement scope; never rewrite historical snapshots.
- Names, anchors, group membership and data order must survive conversion.

## Progress

- [x] Owner confirmed named Area variable with ordered entry array.
- [x] Seven-step plan recorded; scope includes retirement and post-cleanup checks.
- [x] Current behavior inventory and isolated conversion probe.
- [ ] New template and concrete gap decisions.
- [ ] Runtime/Service gaps implemented and tested.
- [ ] Full PDF acceptance.
- [ ] Matched performance acceptance.
- [ ] Active cutover, retirement and final checks.

Current source inspection: model17 owned-area validation explicitly accepts
rowGroups, and expandArea selects section/local/global variable storage then
expands each owned fragment. This supports a conversion probe, not yet a claim
that SRS fully works through Areas. Generic snapshot currently describes older
Editor work; this explicit owner request and the capacity/alignment record are
the relevant single-room context. No old execution context is reopened.

Discovery result: converted four content sections (436entries) to authored
section Area variables. Core validation/preparation/composition pass without
warnings; normalized resolved content equals the original. Service assembly
round-trip preserves serialized JSON (null-prototype dictionaries normalized
only for the comparison). Fresh Linux before/after98-page PDFs have identical
decoded drawing streams, resources, geometry and links. Evidence: probe-result.json
and parity.json under the stated artifact folder. Probe import-name and prototype
comparison mistakes were corrected before PASS; neither required product changes.

Owner decision: malformed/unknown Area entries in the new structure must fail
generation with their indexed path, never skip and output an incomplete SRS.
Implementation ruling: model18 versions the new authored-section/Area-only
contract, strict Area entries and root page-break node; models4–17 retain their
published reader behavior. This is compatibility still in use, not dead code.
New model sections must use authored/blank sources and no direct formats;
request content is rejected even if empty. Existing variable scope names remain
to avoid unrelated API renaming. Core worktree `flowdoc-core-area-v18` and Service
`flowdoc-service-area-v18`, branch `codex/area-document-v18`, start at the release
snapshots above. Runtime authority now implementation for these isolated lanes;
review actual version feature gates individually and retain old-model tests.
